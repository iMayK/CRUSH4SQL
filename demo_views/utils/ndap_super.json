The results of the survey reveals that during 2015-16, about 11.13 crore workers were engaged in unincorporated non-agricultural enterprises (excluding construction) in the country. Among the workers, 55 % worked in urban areas and 45 % worked in rural areas. The Own Account Enterprises (OAEs) accounted for 62 % of the workforce in the unincorporated non-agricultural sector (excluding construction) in the country. At all India level, workers in the OAEs outnumbered those engaged by establishments in all the broad activity categories. Similar pattern is observed in rural areas also.

It is a micronutrient and normally required around 100-150 microgram for normal growth and development. \u00a0Deficiency of iodine in the diet may result in the development of goiter and other iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) including physical and mental retardation and endemic cretinism.

The data collection approach in these surveys is inquiry based which implies that the information on the input use is obtained by inquiry from the farmer. The farmer is visited repeatedly during the growth stage of the crop and during the time of harvest so that the information on input use is correctly and properly recorded. As a result a huge volume of data is generated through these surveys. The data so collected is generally used to work out cost per unit area or cost per unit weight.",

The KCC scheme is being implemented by the all Co-operative banks, Regional Rural Banks and Public Sector Banks throughout the country. Through the KCC scheme, farmers are exempted from the high interest rates of the loans offered by regular banks. The interest rates for KCC is between 2%-4%. This low interest rate helps farmers in repaying loans better, of course taking into account the harvesting period of the crop and the date at which the loan was granted.",

The major objective of the fund is to facilitate the States in mobilizing the resources for expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation by taking up special and innovative projects and also for incentivising micro irrigation beyond the provisions available under Per Drop More Crop ( PDMC ) scheme to encourage farmers to install Micro Irrigation systems",

Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is both a medical and social disorder. The medical problem is due to the social problems at home. Incorrect breast feeding practices, late introduction of complementary feeds, inappropriate foods and feeding practices, feeding diluted feeds containing less amount of nutrients, repeated cases of diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, malaria and measles. SAM increases significantly the risk of death in children under five years of age. It can be direct cause of child death by increasing the case fatality rate in children suffering from common illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia. Children who are severely wasted are 9 times more likely to die than well-nourished children.",

The indicators includes number of animals vaccinated, total Livestock, percentage of animals vaccinated NA17, artificial insemination coverage (cattle & buffaloes), total cattle & buffaloes and percentage of artificial insemination coverage (cattle & buffaloes) NA18. Artificial insemination is the technique in which semen with living sperms is collected from the male and introduced into female reproductive tract at proper time with the help of instruments. This has been found to result in a normal offspring. Artificial insemination is not merely a novel method of bringing about impregnation in females. Instead, it is a powerful tool mostly employed for livestock improvement.",

For a central bank, the concept of liquidity management typically refers to the framework and set of instruments that the central bank follows in steering the amount of bank reserves in order to anchor the money market interest rates around the policy rate. The importance of central bank liquidity management lies in its ability to exercise considerable influence and control over short-term interest rates and thereby affecting the entire interest rate term structure, which is important to monetary policy transmission. Central bank liquidity management has short-term effects on financial markets. However, the medium-term implications for the real sector and the inflation situation are particularly important.",

It is an important indicator of a country's vulnerability to external shocks and its ability to service its debt obligations. The stock of India\u2019s external debt is thus modest in a cross-country perspective. Among the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), India, as at end-December 2021, was the third largest externally indebted country following China and Brazil. In terms of various debt vulnerability indicators, India\u2019s sustainability was better than the Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) as a group and vis-\u00e0-vis many of them individually. India\u2019s external debt position among the LMICs based on various sustainability indicators improves further in terms of the present value arrived at by discounting the nominal value of all future debt service payments.",

Yield movement can be influenced by various factors, including changes in interest rates, economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. For example, if interest rates rise, the yield on a bond will also increase, and vice versa. Yield to maturity (YTM) is a special measure of the total return expected on a bond each year if the bond is held until maturity. It differs from nominal yield, which is usually calculated on a per-year basis and is subject to change with each passing year. On the other hand, YTM is the average yield expected per year and the value is expected to remain constant throughout the holding period until the maturity of the bond.",

        "name": "External Debt by Borrower Classification (US Dollar)",
        "overview": "External Debt by Borrower Classification refers to the categorization of external debt based on the type of borrower. External debt is the portion of a country's total debt that is owed to creditors outside the country. The borrower classification categories typically include government, banks, other financial institutions, and corporations. The breakdown of external debt by borrower classification can provide insights into a country's debt structure and level of indebtedness to different types of creditors. However, without the data for each borrower classification, it is not possible to provide a detailed breakdown of India's External Debt by Borrower Classification.External debt is the portion of a country's debt that is borrowed from foreign lenders, including commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions. These loans, including interest, must usually be paid in the currency in which the loan was made. Normally these types of debts are in the form of tied loans, meaning that these have to be used for a predefined purpose as determined by a consensus of the borrower and the lender. If governments lack the funds required for capital expenditures to boost income levels and out in the economy, they often take on foreign debt.",

In the context of the domestic financial system, it is often viewed as safer and more liquid than privately issued debt. The deep reason for this is the sovereign's power to tax future income. Buying and selling sovereign debt helps economic agents cope with liquidity shocks, smooth consumption, and realize investment opportunities. However, there is also another perspective on sovereign debt, which focuses on the difficulty of enforcing sovereign debt contracts, particularly if the holders of debt are foreign investors. The problem is not necessarily the lack of a legal framework, as sovereign debtors can issue debt in foreign jurisdictions whose legal systems are independent from the debtor's influence.",
