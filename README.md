# CRUSH4SQL
## Collective Retrieval Using Schema Hallucination For Text2SQL

* Research paper and dataset information Coming soon* âœ¨

## About CRUSH4SQL
*CRUSH* leverages LLM hallucination (generally considered a nuisance) in conjunction with dense retrieval, to identify a small, high-recall subset of schema elements for a downstream Text-to-SQL stage.

## Demo
Meanwhile, you can try out our demo for SocialDB by running the [CRUSH_demo.ipynb](demo/CRUSH_demo.ipynb) notebook.
